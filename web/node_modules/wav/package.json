Therefore the WAVE header will contain\na byte-length if `0` initially, which most WAVE decoders will know means to\njust read until `EOF`.\n\nOptionally, if you are in a situation where you can seek back to the beginning\nof the destination of the WAVE file (like writing to a regular file, for\nexample), then you may listen for the `\"header\"` event which will be emitted\n_after_ all the data has been written, and you can go back and rewrite the new\nheader with proper audio byte length into the beginning of the destination\n(though if your destination _is_ a regular file, you should use the the\n`FileWriter` class instead).\n\n### FileWriter()\n\nThe `FileWriter` class.\n",
